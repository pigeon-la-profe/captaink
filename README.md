MSX-BASIC game
Captain Krik is a MSX game developed using MSX-BASIC. The game requires MSX-BASIC KUN rom, inserted in one slot.
Game is presented in a dsk image file. This format is intended to be use in emulators, but the needed files, excepting MSX-BASIC KUN rom, can be also found in this repository and can be copied to a real disk and used in a real MSX machine.
The MSX-BASIC game uses as more memory available in the machine. For this reason it is needed to maintain pushed the CRTL key during the machine startup.
